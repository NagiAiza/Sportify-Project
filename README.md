### Installation & Execution
1.  **Download the Project**: Clone the repository or download the source code files into a folder.
2.  **Setup the Database**:
    * Start the Apache and MySQL services from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    * Open `phpMyAdmin` (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    * Create a new database.
