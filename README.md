## üìú About The Project
The goal of Sportify is to create a seamless online platform where clients can easily connect with sports professionals. Clients can browse a comprehensive list of all available specialists, select their preferred one, and view detailed information such as their CV, contact details, and weekly schedule to check for availability. After scheduling an appointment, the client receives a confirmation. The platform is open to all members of the Omnes Education community and also supports live communication with specialists who are online.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The project is built with a classic web stack, as inferred from the repository structure.

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
* **Backend**: PHP
* **Database**: SQL (likely MySQL/MariaDB, based on the `sportify.sql` file)

## üìÅ Project Structure
The repository is organized with distinct folders for different parts of the application:
* **`/php/`**: Contains all the backend server-side logic, including user authentication, database configuration, and appointment processing.
* **`/javascript/`**: Holds the client-side scripts for interactive features like the chat, user login, and search functionality.
* **`/styles/`**: Contains the CSS files for styling the web pages.
* **`/images/` & `/cv/`**: Store static assets like images and specialist CVs.
* **`sportify.sql`**: The SQL database dump file required to set up the database schema and initial data.

### Installation & Execution
1.  **Download the Project**: Clone the repository or download the source code files into a folder.
2.  **Setup the Database**:
    * Start the Apache and MySQL services from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    * Open `phpMyAdmin` (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    * Create a new database.

    * Update the database credentials (host, username, password, database name) to match your local setup.
4.  **Run the Project**:
    * Place the entire project folder inside your web server's root directory (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs` for XAMPP).
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-project-folder-name/`. The `index.html` page should load.
